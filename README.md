# Bloodie-Boo-Blood-Application
Bloodie Boo is a desktop application used to get information of a blood donor who has registered himself firstly.The person who wants the blood then gets the full information of that donor and also Bloodie Boo provides a way to chat with that donor also.
This application has been devised keeping in mind the utility it will serve for being user-friendly, easily accessible and foremost, to connect people from each gender and age group (above 18 years) to voluntarily participate in saving the life via. blood contribution and to not only meet the national demands of our country but is making large in all other countries as well. We are not just seeking a national coverage but it is going to extend to the globe and help citizens globally. Through this application, a portal is created where the blood donee or the needy one can reach out to the blood donor through Donorâ€™s ID and ensures the privacy of the donor so no personal details will be disclosed. With our noble vision and fuller dedication, we are engaged to spread awareness about the insufficient supply and non-availability of the blood to the needy ones.
Also we can chat with the donee who is eagerly wants to donate blood.The only requirment for this is that donor or receiver should have this application .
For a donee we have firstly mentioned wheather He/She is a donor or reciever(who wants blood).If person is a donor than he needs to fill a form so that receiver can get his details and can contact him either through the contact details provided or using the BLOODIE BOO CHAT BASED SYSTEM in which receiver has to manually add the ID of the donor so that he is able to send or receive messages.
